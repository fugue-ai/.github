# Fugue AI

*Computational frameworks for semantic intelligence and contextual AI systems*

## Mission

Fugue AI builds developer tools for creating AI systems that understand context across different cultures, domains, and organizations.

## Research Focus

- **Context-Aware System Integration**: Frameworks for semantic system connections
- **Semantic Type Safety for AI**: Type systems for semantic consistency
- **Cross-Cultural AI Frameworks**: Tools for multi-cultural AI systems
- **Composable Agent Personalities**: Components for consistent AI behavior

## Development Philosophy

- **Rigorous Foundations**: Built on mathematical foundations with formal verification
- **Cultural Awareness**: Universal interfaces that respect cultural diversity
- **Developer Experience**: Practical APIs that don't require deep theoretical knowledge
- **Human Communication**: Model human-AI recursion to advance future interaction patterns
